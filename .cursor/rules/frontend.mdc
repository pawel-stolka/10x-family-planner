## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes instead of NgModules
- Implement signals for state management instead of traditional RxJS-based approaches
- Use the new inject function instead of constructor injection
- Implement control flow with @if, @for, and @switch instead of *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Use the new deferrable views for improved loading states
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Implement proper lazy loading with loadComponent and loadChildren


#### ANGULAR_MATERIAL

- For standalone components: Create a shared constants file (e.g., `material-imports.ts`) that exports arrays of Material components for reuse
- Alternatively: Use provideAnimations() in app.config.ts and import Material components directly where needed
- Use theme mixins to customize component styles instead of overriding CSS
- Implement OnPush change detection for performance critical components
- Leverage the CDK (Component Development Kit) for custom component behaviors
- Use Material's form field components with reactive forms for consistent validation UX
- Implement accessibility attributes and ARIA labels for interactive components
- Use Material 3 design system (all new components support M3 theming)
- Leverage the Angular Material theming system for consistent branding
- Implement proper typography hierarchy using the Material typography system
- Use Angular Material's built-in a11y features like focus indicators and keyboard navigation
- Install with: ng add @angular/material (automatically sets up themes and animations)


### Guidelines for STYLING

#### SCSS

- Use the ThemeProvider for consistent theming across components
- Implement the css helper for sharing styles between components
- Use the as prop for dynamic component rendering
- Implement the css prop for one-off styling needs
- Use the & character for nesting selectors
- Leverage the keyframes helper for animations

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CI_CD

#### GITHUB_ACTIONS

- Check if `package.json` exists in project root and summarize key scripts
- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in project root
- Check if `.env.example` exists in project root to identify key `env:` variables
- Always use terminal command: `git branch -a | cat` to verify whether we use `main` or `master` branch
- Always use `env:` variables and secrets attached to jobs instead of global workflows
- Always use `npm ci` for Node-based dependency setup
