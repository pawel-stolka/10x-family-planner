# AI Rules for Family Life Planner

Both with wife we are parents of 3 kids - I have a work daily 8h, side projects and personal purposes 
(fitness, hobby, shared together time 1:1 with wife / husband) - wife has maternity leave.
We struggle not to have place where we can:
- see all priorities on weekly schedule
- quickly find all activities and meals fit to our family
- balance all priorities: work, family, hobbies and relations


## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### DOC_UPDATES

- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md


### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### MONOREPO

- Configure workspace-aware tooling to optimize build and test processes
- Implement clear package boundaries with explicit dependencies between packages
- Use consistent versioning strategy across all packages (independent or lockstep)
- Configure CI/CD to build and test only affected packages for efficiency
- Implement shared configurations for linting, testing, and {{development_tooling}}
- Use code generators to maintain consistency across similar packages or modules


### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Implement custom rules for {{ PATTERNS TO DO }} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues

#### PRETTIER

- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and {{specific_excluded_patterns}}
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality

### Guidelines for E2E

#### PLAYWRIGHT

- Initialize configuration only with Chromium/Desktop Chrome browser
- Use browser contexts for isolating test environments
- Implement the Page Object Model for maintainable tests
- Use locators for resilient element selection
- Leverage API testing for backend validation
- Implement visual comparison with expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
- Use the codegen tool for test recording
- Leverage trace viewer for debugging test failures
- Implement test hooks for setup and teardown
- Use expect assertions with specific matchers
- Leverage parallel execution for faster test runs
